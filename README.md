# Portfolio

**[Live](https://albert-d-chen.github.io/portfolio/)**

This is my personal site, which primarily showcases the projects I have worked on along with the skills used, such as Javascript, Ruby, Rails, React, Redux, and more. I also post some photos from my hobby of learning photography. Check it out if you want to get to know me a little better!
